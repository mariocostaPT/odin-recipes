    <h3>The portuguese famous pork sandwiches</h3>
    <p>Bifanas are traditional Portuguese sandwiches made with thin slices of pork that are marinated and simmered in a sauce of white wine, garlic, and paprika and served on soft rolls with plenty of mustard and piri-piri sauce.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 thin pork loin steaks – In Portugal, ask for bifanas in a supermarket or butcher shop to get the pork loin already cut to the ideal thickness.</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons pork lard</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
      <li>4 crispy crust buns. In Portugal, look for <i>carcaças</i> or <i>papo-secos</i></li>
      <li>Mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the marinade:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon of sweet paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground chili pepper (piri-piri)</li>
      <li>3 crushed garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>200 ml of dry white wine</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by tenderizing the pork steaks. With a meat mallet or similar, gently work the steaks one by one on both sides.</li>
      <li>Place the processed meat in a container (preferably with a lid), season with salt and black pepper, and add the rest of the marinade ingredients, mix, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, place the lard, olive oil and butter. Bring to medium heat. Once the fats are hot, add the steaks, reserving the marinade. Don't be alarmed by the amount of fat but the idea is to 'confit' the meat instead of frying it as we normally do with steaks.</li>
      <li>When the fat starts to bubble (in approximately 8 minutes), turn the steaks and add the marinade without removing the garlic cloves.</li>
      <li>Stir occasionally and turn the steaks until the garlic is tender. Use a fork to check the texture of the garlic by pressing it against the sides of the pan. When the garlic has softened, reduce the heat and cook until the sauce has reduced a bit.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cut the buns lengthwise and add a generous layer of mustard. Add a steak to each sandwich and finish with plenty of meat cooking sauce!</li>      
    </ol>
