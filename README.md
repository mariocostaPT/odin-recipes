## Introduction

The first project on *The Odin Project Foundation Path*. I am currently a second year computer science student that have previously delve a little into html css and javascript but I want to further my knowledge and delve into all the possibilities this path can bring me.

I am a working student and but studying for my deegre and spending a little extra time on this learning project I can get a more solid foundation.

## Stack

At this moment in time on the odin project only git and html have been though and also some very good knowledge about how the internet work.

I will only use raw html and git to do this project and see what comes from it!
